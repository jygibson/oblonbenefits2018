                <b> Oblon offers two medical plans</b> currently named Plan B and Plan C, both utilizing the Innovation
                Health/Aetna National Network. Both plans are what is considered "self-funded". Self-funded means that
                while the plan uses the Aetna network and Aetna acts as a third party administrator for the claims, the
                Firm foots the bills.
                <br>
                <br>
                Both of the plans are high deductible plans, sometimes referred to as consumer driven. You will
                frequently see the acronyms HDHP or CDHP when referring to them. The biggest difference between the two
                plans on their face is that Plan B has higher premiums and lower deductibles/out-of-pocket maximums.
                Plan C has lower premiums, and higher deductibles/out-of-pocket maximums.
                Because both plans are HDHPs, enrolling in either makes you eligible for a <a href="hsa.html"> Health

                <h4>I know what Aetna is, but what's Innovation Health?</h4>
                <p>Innovation Health is an partnership between nationally known Aetna, and locally known INOVA. This
                    partnership means that while the entire Aetna Open POS II network is in-network for you, utilizing
                    INOVA providers for your visits will come with even steeper discounts. When searching the Aetna
                    site for a doctor, use "Open POS II". </p>

                <h4>What's a CDHP/HDHP?</h4>
                <p> Consumer Driven Health Plans/High Deductible Health Plans have higher deductibles than traditional
                    plans and must meet a few government
                    regulations. The premiums are typically much lower then standard plans, but you must reach a higher
                    deductible before the plan cost sharing kicks in. Oblon’s CDHPs use a PPO Network, meaning your
                    costs will be less if you stay in-network. However, you can use out-of-network providers if you
                    prefer. These plans have higher deductibles than traditional plans and must meet a few government
                    required regulations. The premiums are typically much lower then standard plans, but you must reach
                    a higher deductible before the plan cost sharing kicks in. Oblon’s CDHPs use a PPO Network, meaning
                    your costs will be less if you stay in-network. However, you can use out-of-network providers if
                    you prefer. IRS qualified CDHP/HDHPs allow a participant to also enroll in a <a href="hsa.html">Health

                <h4>When do the premiums come out of my check?</h4>
                <p> Premiums are deducted from each check, semi-monthly (which is twice a month). Our premiums are
                    based on your earnings tier and level of coverage (employee only, employee + 1, or employee +
                    family). You can find detailed cost information on each plan page. </p>

                <h4>When will I get my insurance card?</h4>
                <p> You will receive your card in the mail
                    within 15 business days. If you need a card before it
                    arrives, there are two options. You can either print out a paper card by registering with the <a
                        href="www.innovation-health.com">Innovation Health portal</a>, and downloading it from there.
                    Or, you can use an electronic card by downloading the Aetna mobile app on your
                    phone and signing in. </p>

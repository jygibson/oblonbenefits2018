Oblon Benefits Site 

This site was designed for my current position as an additional open enrollment initiative. Our employees frequently do not understand their benefits and we are continually try to find new ways to help communicate them. I designed to have any easy navigation bar where they could click through to find the specific benefit information they were seeking. Additionally, the site is available of the company's network, which means they can view it at home and send to spouses. Employees can also use the site to email members of HR or the whole team directly with questions. 

The information on this site is propriety information of Oblon, McClelland, Maier & Neustadt LLP and is not to be shared for purposes outside of viewing my coding work. Thank you!

To create this site, I just used HTML and CSS with Bootstrap.

            <div class="col"> <b><em>Health Savings Accounts:</em> </b> Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are savings accounts with
                a few unique features. First, it's
                a tax-preferred savings account and you can only use the funds for medical, dental, and vision
                purposes.
                All contributions are deposited pre-tax, thus lowering your taxable income. This account is yours, just
                like
                a regular savings account, and it stays with you forever, even if you leave the Firm. In order to be
                enrolled
                in an HSA, you must be enrolled in what is called a high deductible (or consumer driven) health plan.
                All
                of Oblon's plans meet these requirements, so if you're on our medical plans there is no need to worry.
                You
                can make your HSA work for your needs. Some people like to use it up front to meet the higher
                deductibles
                and out of pockets on these types of plans. However, many people try not to use their HSAs so that they
                grow
                large enough to use during retirement!
            </div>

        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"> <b><em>Another perq, you say?:</em></b> An additional great feature of the HSAs is that you can
                invest your money using one. Once your balance
                reaches $1,000, you can invest in the vendor's options, and any dividends your investments will accrue
                in
                your account - tax free!</div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><b><em>How to Use Your HSA:</em> </b> HSAs (and FSAs) are administered through a company called
                Trion. You do have access to a secure online portal that holds all your account information here: <a
                    href="https://trion.lh1ondemand.com"> Trion Portal</a>. Once you are enrolled in an HSA, you will
                receive what is called a "benny" card in the mail, along with instructions for registering with the
                portal.
                The benny card acts like a debit card, and you swipe it at the point of sale. The envelope(s) will be
                minimally
                marked,
                so be careful not to toss it. Each benny card is good for five years. You will have an option to change
                your
                contribution
                amounts quarterly, which isn't mandatory, but you <b> must</b> re-elect the HSA each year during open
                enrollment
                to continue your contributions. </div>

                <b> <em>The importance of paying attention to your snail-mail</em>:</b> Several communications, including benny
                cards, come in the mail to your address from Trion. While none of us expect real mail anymore these
                days, it's important to pay attention to your mail for these items. The envelopes are minimally marked,
                with either "Trion" or "MMA Marketlink" listed on them. In addition to your cards, these communications
                can include instructions for registering with the portal, or if there are <i> any issues opening your
                    account</i>. Under the Patriot Act, federal law requires financial institutinos to obtain, verify,
                and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. On occasion, Trion will need
                more informaiton from you to do so, <i>and these requests will come via snail mail. Please look at
                    your mail!</i>

                <p> <b>Please note the following:</b><br>
                    Oblon's plans are self-funded. Self-funded plans rely on what are called "premium equivalents" and
                    do not pay
                    out premiums to an insurance company. In this instance, the term premium is used to more easily
                    facilitate
                    communications.</p>
                <p>Deductibles and Out of Pocket values are <b>annual</b> amounts. These values always reset at the
                    beginning
                    of the
                    year (January 1, 20xx), regardless of when in the year you began working for Oblon.</p>
                <p><b>How your salary band is calculated?</b> Salary bands are based on your W-2 earnings from the
                    prior year.
                    This number includes your hourly/salaried wages, any overtime worked, and/or your draw + billings.
                    Bands are
                    recalculated each year, and you will be notified by HR if you will be changing salary bands. </p>
                <p><b>Plan C has"embedded" deductibles and out of pocket maximum:</b> Plan C has what is called a
                    "embedded"
                    deductible. ‘Embedded’ plans were designed so that no single person’s costs go over
                    their plan's individual out of pocket maximum. In 2019, the maximum out of pocket limit for
                    individuals is $5,000. Once one of your family members reaches the individual deductible maximum
                    ($3,000), the plan cost sharing begins for that family member (Firm pays 90%, you pay 10%).
                    Remaining family members will need to reach the aggregate deductible with their claims before the
                    cost sharing begins for them. This also applies to the Out-of-Pocket maximum. </p>

            <div class="col-4">
                <p><b>Preventive Care:</b> Under the Affordable Care Act, preventive care is covered at 100%, as long
                    as you
                    meet the requirements and stay in-network. </p>
                <p><b>How does it work?:</b> Each time you go to the doctor for a service that is not preventive care,
                    they
                    will
                    charge you the full Aetna-negotiated amount, until you reach your deductible. Once your deductible
                    is met,
                    the
                    Plan's cost sharing begins. The Firm pays 90% and you pay 10% of claims, and prescription costs
                    become
                    co-pays.
                    This continues until you reach your out-of-pocket
                    maximum. Once you reach the out-of-pocket maximum, your services are covered at 100%. </p><br>

                    services. Please view the plan
                    document for complete benefit information. In the event that the plan book differs from what is
                    here, the plan

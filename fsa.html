                <h5>Standard Flexible Spending Account</h5>
                <p class="dates">Standard FSAs are pre-tax contribution accounts in which the value can be used for
                    uncovered medical, dental,
                    and vision costs. You can elect a value each year up to the IRS limit. Your full elected amount is
                    available to you on the first day of the year, and then the Firm deducts a smaller amount each pay
                    check of the year, to equal the total. For example, if you elected $2,000 for the year, $2,000
                    would be available for you to use on 1/1. Then, you would pay $83.30 a pay period (24 pay periods)
                    to make up the cost.</p>
                <p> Once enrolled, you will receive what is called a "benny" card in the mail. This card works like a
                    debit card and holds your FSA balance. You can use your FSA with either this card, or through the
                    Trion portal. </p>
                <p>You need to re-enroll in the FSA every year during Open Enrollment.</p>
                <p>If you have a Health Savings Account, you cannot have a Standard Flexible Spending Account.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <h5>Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Account</h5>
                <p class="dates"> Because you cannot have a Standard Flexible Spending Account if you are enrolled in a
                    Health Savings Account, another kind of FSA has been created: the Limited Purpose Flexible Spending
                    Account. The LPFSA is a pre-tax contribution account that can be used in conjunction with your HSA.
                    It works identically to the
                    Standard FSA, however the amount can only be used for dental and vision benefits. You cannot use
                    any part of the LPFSA for medical costs. Your full elected amount is available to you on the first
                    day of the year, and then the firm deducts a smaller amount each pay check to equal the total. </p>
                <p> Once enrolled, you will receive what is called a "benny" card in the mail. This card works like a
                    debit card and holds your LPFSA balance. You can either use your LPFSA with this card, or through
                    the Trion portal. </p>
                <p> You need to re-enroll in your LPFSA every year during Open Enrollment. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <h5>Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account</h5>
                <p class="dates">Dependent Care FSA is rather different then the other two types. It is also a pre-tax
                    contribution account. Dependent Care FSA is
                    designed to help with the costs of day care for children under the age of 13 and/or family members
                    who may be physically or mentally incapable of self care and lives in your home. There are some
                    intricacies for how to use this plan and who you can pay with it, so be sure to check the IRS
                    website or with your tax advisor for guidance. </p>
                <p>Unlike the other
                    two FSAs types,
                    the DCFSA value is not given to you in advance. You can only use the money is it accrues, and you
                    will not receive a "benny" card for it. You can make your payments from this account through the
                    Trion portal.</p>
                <p>You need to re-enroll in your DCFSA every year during open enrollment. </p>

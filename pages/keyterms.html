                    <td class="definition">The amount of money deducted from your paycheck to ensure that you have
                        insurance. It is what
                        you pay in order to be covered. The premium is the cost of being covered- not the cost of care.

                    <td class="definition">For insurance plans, you need to spend a certain amount of money before the
                        plan begins sharing
                        the costs. This amount of money is called the deductible. Depending on the plan and it's setup,
                        the deductible can be large or small. If the deductible is over $1,300 for an individual and
                        $2,600 for a family, it's considered a "high deductible" plan, and eligible to be paired with a
                        health savings account. Typically, plans with lower premiums have higher deductibles, and plans
                        with higher premiums have lower deductibles. </td>

                <tr>
                    <td class="terms">Co-insurance</td>
                    <td class="definition">Once you meet your deductible, your plan begins to share costs with you for
                        doctor visits,
                        procedures, etc. The plan pays a certain percentage of the cost, and you pay a certain
                        percentage. The amount that you are paying is the co-insurance. For example, if your plan pays
                        90% toward a specialist visit, the 10% they don’t pay is your co-insurance. You pay
                        co-insurance until you meet your out-of-pocket maximum (which can vary depending on whether you
                        stay in-network or go out-of-network).</td>
                </tr>
                <td class="terms">Out of Pocket Maximum</td>
                <td class="definition">The out of pocket maximum is the most you will pay in a single plan year. It
                    does not include your
                    premiums, or any service your plan does not cover. Once you reach this number, the plan pays 100%
                    of all services. The maximum is typically different for individual coverage versus family coverage.
                    The ACA puts limits on how high these can be.</td>

                <td class="terms">Co-pay(ment)</td>
                <td class="definition">This is a fixed amount that you pay for a specific service. For example, despite
                    what the full cost
                    of a office visit to your doctor may be, you will always pay just $10 (or whatever the plan's
                    co-pay is) instead. This can apply to
                    prescriptions as well. Plans B and C do not have office visit co-pays, but once you meet your
                    deductible, presscriptions go to co-pay tiers until you meet your out of pocket maximum.</td>

                <td class="definition">This refers to a provider or a facility that is within a insurance plan’s
                    “network of approved
                    providers”. This means they have agreed to a negotiated discount rate for plan participants (that’s
                    you) and are contractually obligated to comply and accept plan payments in full. You will pay less
                    (and more reasonable amounts) when using an in-network doctor or facility.</td>

            </tbody>
            <td class="terms">Out-of-Network</td>
            <td class="definition">This refers to a provider or facility that is outside an insurance plan’s “network
                of approved
                providers”. They are not contracted to any rate or discount and they can charge however much they
                please, and you will not only typically pay more in general, but you will likely be stuck paying much
                more.</td>

                    <b> Oblon offers three medical plans</b> named Plan B, Plan C, and Plan D, all which utilize the
                    Innovation
                    Health/Aetna National Network. Both plans are "self-funded". Self-funded means that
                    while the Plans use the Aetna network, with Aetna playing the role of third party administrator fto
                    process our claims; the
                    Firm itself pays the bill as opposed to an insurance company.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Plans B & C are high deductible health plans, sometimes referred to as consumer driven
                    health
                    plans. You will
                    frequently see the acronyms HDHP or CDHP when referring to them. The biggest difference between the
                    two
                    plans on their face is that Plan B has higher premiums and lower deductibles/out-of-pocket maximums.
                    Plan C however, has lower premiums, and higher deductibles/out-of-pocket maximums.
                    Because both plans are HDHPs, enrolling in either makes you eligible to participate in a <a
                        href="hsa.html" target="_blank">

                    <br>
                    Plan D is new in 2020, and is a traditional PPO plan with standard co-pays. The biggest difference
                    between the other plans and Plan D is that instead of meeting the deductible before the plan begins
                    as with B and C,
                    the partipant pays co-pays for most services before the deductible in D. Plan D has higher premiums
                    and higher out-of-pocket maximums than Plans B & C, but it has co-pays and a lower deductible.
                    Because Plan D is a traditional PPO plan, you cannot have an HSA with the plan. You can however,
                    have a standard medical FSA.

                    <h4>I know what Aetna is, but what's Innovation Health?</h4>
                    <p>Innovation Health is a partnership between nationally known Aetna, and locally known INOVA.
                        This
                        partnership means that while the entire Aetna Open POS II network is in-network for you,
                        utilizing
                        INOVA providers for your visits will come with even steeper discounts. When searching the
                        Aetna
                        site for a doctor, use "Open POS II". </p>

                <div class="col-3">
                    <h4>What's a CDHP/HDHP?</h4>
                    <p> Consumer Driven Health Plans/High Deductible Health Plans have higher deductibles than
                        traditional
                        plans and must meet a few government
                        regulations. The premiums are typically much lower than standard plans, but you must reach
                        a higher
                        deductible threshold before the plan cost sharing kicks in. Oblonâ€™s CDHPs use a PPO Network,
                        meaning
                        your
                        costs will be less if you stay in-network. You can use out-of-network providers if
                        you
                        prefer, however your out-of-pocket costs will be less if you stay in-network. As mentioned
                        above,
                        IRS qualified CDHP/HDHPs allow a participant to also enroll in a <a href="hsa.html"

                    <h4>When do the premiums come out of my pay?</h4>
                    <p> Premiums are deducted on each pay date, semi-monthly (which is twice a month). Our premiums
                        are
                        based on your earnings tier and level of coverage (employee only, employee + 1, or employee
                        +
                        family). You can find detailed cost information on each plan page. </p>

                    <h4>When will I get my insurance card?</h4>
                    <p> You will receive your card in the mail
                        within 15 business days. If you need a card before it
                        arrives, there are two options. You can either print out a paper card by registering with
                        the <a href="http://www.innovation-health.com" target="_blank">Innovation Health portal</a>,
                        and downloading it from there, or you can use an electronic card by downloading the Aetna mobile
                        app on your
                        phone and signing in. We strongly recommend you register on the Innovation Health portal to take
                        advantage of their web-tools to help find medical providers/services/prescriptions at the lowest

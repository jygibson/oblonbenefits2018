            <div class="col"> <b><em>Health Savings Accounts:</em> </b> Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are savings
                accounts with
                a few unique features. First, it's
                a tax-preferred savings account (which means pre-tax contributions) but you can only use the funds for
                medical, dental, and vision
                purposes.
                All contributions are deducted on paydates, pre-tax, thus lowering your taxable income. This account's
                funds are yours, just
                like
                a regular savings account, and it remains in your account forever, even if you separate from the Firm.
                In order to be
                enrolled
                in an HSA, you must be enrolled in what is called a high deductible (or consumer driven) health plan.
                All
                of Oblon's plans meet these requirements, so if you're on one of our medical plans there is no need to
                worry.
                You
                can make your HSA savings work for your needs. Some people like to use it up front to pay their
                co-insurance bills, some people like to save it to match their deductible, and some people try not to
                use their HSAs at all so that the account
                grows
                large enough to use during retirement!
            </div>
            <br>

        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"> <b><em>Another perq, you say?:</em></b> An additional great feature of the HSAs is that
                you can
                invest the money sitting in your HSA, once your balance
                reaches $1,000. See the vendor's options for investments, and remember that any dividends your
                investments earn are also tax free!</div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><b><em>How to Use Your HSA:</em> </b> HSAs (and FSAs) are administered through a company
                called
                Trion. You do have access to a secure online portal that holds all your account information here: <a
                    href="https://trion.lh1ondemand.com" target="_blank"> Trion Portal</a>. Once you are enrolled in an
                HSA, you will
                receive what is called a "benny" card in the mail, along with instructions for registering with the
                portal.
                The benny card acts like a debit card, and you swipe it at the point of sale. The envelope(s) will be
                minimally
                marked,
                so be careful not to toss it. Each benny card is good for five years. You will have an option to change
                your
                contribution
                amounts quarterly, which isn't mandatory, but you <b> must</b> re-elect the HSA each year during open
                enrollment
                to continue your contributions. </div>

                <b> <em>The importance of paying attention to your snail-mail</em>:</b> Several communications,
                including benny
                cards, come in the mail to your address from Trion. While none of us expect real mail anymore these
                days, it's important to pay attention to your mail for these items. The envelopes are minimally marked,
                with either "Trion" or "MMA Marketlink" listed on them. In addition to your cards, these communications
                can include instructions for registering with the portal, or if there are <i> any issues opening your
                    account</i>. Under the Patriot Act, federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify,
                and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. On occasion, Trion will need
                more information from you to do so, <i>and these requests will come via snail mail. Please look at
                    your mail!</i>

            <p> HSAs have some unique eligiblity requirements that are different than plans you may be used to. First,
                in order to be eligible you must enrolled in a high deductible health plan. Secondly, you <b>may not</b>
                be enroll in <b>any</b> part of Medicare (Parts A, B, C or D!), you may not be enrolled in Tricare
                (even as secondary coverage), you may not have secondary coverage and you cannot be someone else's tax
                dependent.</p>
            <p>Dependent children must be under* 24 years of age and meet the regular <a href="eligibility.html" target="_blank">eligibility</a>
                requirements. If the child is between the ages of 18-24, they must be a full time student.

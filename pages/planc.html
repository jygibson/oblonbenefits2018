                <p> <b>Please note the following:</b><br>
                    Oblon's plans are self-funded. Self-funded plans rely on what are called "premium equivalents" and
                    do not pay
                    out premiums to an insurance company. In this instance, the term premium is used to more easily
                    facilitate
                    communications.</p>
                <p>Deductibles and Out of Pocket values are <b>annual</b> amounts. These values always reset at the
                    beginning
                    of the
                    year (January 1, 20xx), regardless of when in the year you began working for Oblon.</p>
                <p><b>How your salary band is calculated?</b> Salary bands are based on your W-2 earnings from the
                    prior year.
                    This number includes your hourly/salaried wages, any overtime worked, and/or your draw + billings.
                    Bands are
                    recalculated each year, and you will be notified by HR if you will be changing salary bands. </p>

                <p><b>Embedded Deductible:</b> Plan C's
                    "embedded" deductible is designed as a safety net so that if one family member's medical costs
                    reach the Plan's individual deductible maximum ($3,000), the Plan's cost sharing will begin for
                    that family member (Firm pays 90%, you pay 10%). Remaining family members will need to reach the
                    aggregate deductible with their claims before cost sharing begins for them. </p>
                <p><b>Embedded Out-of-Pocket Max:</b> Plan C's "embedded" maximum out of pocket limit is designed as a
                    safety net so that if one family member's medical costs reach the Plan's individual out-of-pocket
                    maximum ($5,000), the Plan's 100% coverage will begin for that family member (Firm pays 100%, you
                    pay 0%).</p>

                <p><b>Preventive Care:</b> Under the Affordable Care Act, preventive care is covered at 100%, as long
                    as you
                    meet the requirements and stay in-network. </p>
                <p><b>How does it work?:</b> Each time you go to the doctor for a service that is not preventive care,
                    they
                    will
                    charge you the full Aetna-negotiated amount, until you reach your deductible. Once your deductible
                    is met,
                    the
                    Plan's cost sharing begins. The Firm pays 90% and you pay 10% of claims, and prescription costs
                    become
                    co-pays.
                    This continues until you reach your out-of-pocket
                    maximum. Once you reach the out-of-pocket maximum, your services are covered at 100%. </p><br>
